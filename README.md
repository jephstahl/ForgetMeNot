# ForgetMeNot
 Global Game Jam Design Lost&Found 2021 for Move38 Blinks

GAME OVERVIEW
A Single Player Memory Puzzle with 7 Blinks

"Forget Me Not" is a game children play with by pulling petals off of a flower to determine if a love, loves them back.
In ForgetMeNot for Blinks, we recall our lost loves again, and test our memory with this challenging game.
The petals of the flowers will bloom and show at first a variaty of colours.  
Pay attention and try to remember the colours and the positions.
Time passes and the flower folds up and the blink petals go dark... keep remembering..
The flower unfolds again, but one petal has been lost to you memory... OR HAS IT???
Identify the changed petal and progress throught he level.

SETUP

Assemble 7 blinks in a shape of a flower blossom, with 1 blink in the center of 6 blink petals.
The center blink will pulse green, indicating it is ready to bloom and start the first round.

GAMEPLAY

Single click the center blink to start.
First the new petals will be displayed.
Next the petals will go dark.
When they return 1 will be LOST.
Identify the LOST petal by single clicking on where it was.
If you are correct this blink will pulse with the memory, and you can progress to the next round of difficulty.
If you are incorrect the flower will blush red and your progress will be lost and the game will restart.
