GAME OVERVIEW
A Single Player Memory Puzzle with 7 Blinks

"Loves me... Loves me not" is a game children play with by pulling petals off of a flower to determine if a love, loves them back.
In ForgetMeNot for Blinks, we recall our lost loves again, and test our memory with this challenging game.
The petals of the flowers will bloom and show at first a variaty of colours.  
Pay attention and try to remember the colours and the positions.
Time passes and the flower folds up and the blink petals go dark... keep remembering..
The flower unfolds again, but one petal has been lost to you memory... OR HAS IT???
Identify the changed petal and progress throught the different flowers, and evetually increased difficulty

There is no scoring in this game, each flower you can picture peticular someone in your minds eye.
Did you succeed?  Maybe they do indeed love you.  Fail? Sorry.... next flower!!
